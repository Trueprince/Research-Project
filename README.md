# 1	Introduction
## 1.1	 Background
Over the past few years, mobile apps downloads have risen significantly, showing a consistent increase between 2016 and 2022. Nevertheless, this upward trajectory plateaued in 2023, with global application downloads reaching 257 billion, marking a modest increase of merely one percent compared to the preceding year  (Laura, 2025). In 2024, only 137.8 billion apps were downloaded, showing 1% decrease (Mansoor, 2025). Mobile banking provides a distinct advantage over traditional banking by enabling customers to perform transactions anytime and anywhere using a mobile device, like a smartphone or tablet, connected to the internet (Dipen, 2024). It provides easy access, control over finances, 24-hour availability, and reduces the cost of handling transactions, making it a convenient and alternative to in-person or computer-based banking (Sadiku et al., 2017). By the 1990s, the United States saw the introduction of mobile banking services, heralding a new era of digital financial exchanges (Alsmadi et al., 2022). Originating in the late 1990s and early 2000s, these services initially relied on short messaging services (SMS), Wireless Application Protocol (WAP), or mobile devices equipped with General Packet Radio Services (GPRS) (Gupta et al., 2020). 
As the field of mobile banking progresses, research is increasingly concentrating on enhancing service quality and customer satisfaction (Bhatt & Nagar, 2021). Reviews on platforms like the Google Play Store and Apple App Store provide crucial insights into customer opinions, helping financial organizations enhance their mobile banking services. Online reviews in the realm of mobile banking are essential for more than merely assessing service quality; they serve as a key indicator of user expectations, levels of satisfaction, and areas where services fall short (Hussain et al., 2023). Positive reviews highlight aspects such as security, convenience, user-friendliness, ongoing enhancements, application utility, and its features, whereas negative review points out concerns like system availability, responsiveness, problematic updates, login issues, and reliability (Hussain et al., 2023). The study by (Alrizq & Alghamdi, 2024) use methods like Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to discover factors that contribute to customers’ satisfaction and subsequently using Support Vector Regression (SVR), and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to predict customers’ satisfaction as result identified critical factors that influence customer satisfaction, such as app updates, functionality, design, and navigation.
While prior studies on mobile banking apps have primarily focused on identifying patterns in the content of negative reviews or modelling overall user satisfaction vs. dissatisfaction (Hussain et al., 2023), these approaches tend to aggregate user feedback across long periods. As a result, they fail to capture temporally discrete spikes in negative sentiment, which may indicate short-term service disruptions rather than long-standing usability issues or individual dissatisfaction. Such trends are what this study characterises as mobile banking service failures. This research seeks to model the temporal dynamics of negative reviews on a per-app, per-day basis, with the goal of detecting short-term anomalies or spikes in negative user feedback that are indicative of potential systemic failures or acute performance issues. The research proposes that the co-occurrence of multiple negative reviews within a short time window (e.g., a single day) serves as a strong signal of such events, distinguishing them from sporadic, user-specific dissatisfaction. 
By leveraging time series deep learning techniques, we aim to detect, predict, and interpret such temporal anomalies, contributing a new perspective to app review analytics that emphasizes the importance of review density over time, rather than sentiment content alone. Studies integrating Deep Learning and NLP have predominantly focused on stock market forecasting, where sentiment analysis is combined with stock time series data, demonstrating remarkable performance (Abdildayeva et al., 2024; Jabeen et al., 2021; Ko & Chang, 2021; Zhao & Yang, 2022). Methods like sentiment analysis, topic modelling, and Deep Learning algorithms will be utilized to pinpoint essential indicators of service failures. This study will leverage data collected from the Google Play Store, focusing on South African mobile banking apps such as ABSA, Nedbank, FNB, Capitec bank and Standard bank to conduct a thorough analysis
## 1.2	 Problem statement 
The rapid adoption of mobile banking services has led to increased reliance on these platforms for various financial transactions (Kyung-Hun Ha et al., 2012; Sebayang et al., 2024). As usage of these services continue to grow user feedback becomes vital for improving service quality (Hussain et al., 2023). Consequently, user reviews have become an essential source of indicators for observing how individuals engage with mobile banking applications, while ratings are utilised to gauge their level of satisfaction or dissatisfaction (Geebren et al., 2020). This feedback is crucial for banks to address user problems improve app functionality and enhance the overall user experience (Alismail & Albesher, 2023). While mobile banking offers benefits such as round-the-clock access and cost efficiency, service failures remain a significant challenge (Gupta et al., 2020). Customer reviews frequently highlight issues such as system availability, responsiveness, faulty updates, login problems, and reliability concerns (Hussain et al., 2023).
Despite the growing dependence on mobile banking services, there is a lack of comprehensive models that predict service failures. While prior studies on mobile banking apps have primarily focused on identifying patterns in the content of negative reviews or modelling overall user satisfaction vs. dissatisfaction, these approaches tend to aggregate user feedback across long periods (Hussain et al., 2023; Nguyen & Dao, 2024)  While this approach offers a broad assessment of app quality it overlooks time series patterns that could serve as early warning signals for potential service failures. This research seeks to model the temporal dynamics of negative reviews on a per-app, per-day basis, with the goal of detecting short-term anomalies or spikes in negative user feedback that are indicative of potential systemic failures or acute performance issues. We propose that the co-occurrence of multiple negative reviews within a short time window (e.g., a single day) serves as a strong signal of such events, distinguishing them from sporadic, user-specific dissatisfaction. By leveraging deep learning techniques for processing time series data, we aim to detect, predict, and interpret such temporal anomalies, contributing a new perspective to app review analytics that emphasizes the importance of review density over time, rather than sentiment content alone.
By identifying key predictors of service failures through further research, a deep learning model integrating NLP will be developed to analyse user reviews and accurately forecast future failures based on historical data and review patterns (Hussain et al., 2023). This approach will employ time series analysis to identify patterns and irregularities over time, alongside sentiment analysis, topic modelling, and Deep Learning algorithms, to provide actionable insights for improving M-banking service quality and increasing customer satisfaction.
